    <p class="performingtext">Having grown up taking ballet, tap, modern dance, piano, violin and speech & drama lessons, I have
      a deep appreciation for all aspects of the performing arts.
      Taking examinations in these areas on a yearly basis meant that I spent many an hour honing these skills,
      competing in competitions, performing at concerts, including local <strong>Young Musician concerts</strong>, <strong>ABRSM High Scorers Concerts</strong>, and other concerts.
      I've also performed in various dance shows and musicals, including a performance at the <strong>John Smith's Stadium</strong> in Huddersfield.
      Last year I joined the dance studio At Your Beat, based in central London</p>

      <p>I've been interested in meditation and buddhism since my university days. I'm currently especially interested in the Gut-Brain axis and the microbiome.
         Proponent of Professor Tim Spector (Kings College London), Dr Will Bulsiewicz (author of Fibre Fuelled), and Professor Felice Jacka - all who have examined the
          impact that improving gut diversity may have on improving mood. I enjoy attending wellness events such as Balance Festival, which I will be in attendance at this year."

      Almost all of my professional experience so far has been in a frontend-capacity. However, I am interested in back-end development, security and cloud-computing. I hope to achieved
      my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification by the end of the year.

        <p class="techtext">As a developer I am, naturally, interested in all-things tech. I strive to keep up-to-date with the latest news and trends through various means such as reading <strong>TechCrunch,
        TechRadar, Wired</strong>, by listening to podcasts such as the <strong>LadyBug</strong> podcast, and simply by being part of the developer community on Twitter.<br />
        I also try to attend tech meetups when I can such as
        (from left to right): <strong>Node Girls London</strong> at Financial Times, an android development workshop,
        organised by Codebar and hosted by <strong>Trainline</strong>, a Women in Tech event at <strong>Twitter</strong>, a Codebar workshop hosted by Google, <strong>AthenaHack</strong>- an all-female
        hackathon and event hosted by Queen Mary, University of London, Rails Girls London hosted by <strong>Deliveroo.</strong>. I very recently attended the launch
        of Qwik.

        <p class="langtext">There is something thrilling about being able to understand and communicate in another language and having studied modern languages at university, I've had the opportunity to learn a handful of languages; <strong>French, German and Dutch</strong> and a little <strong>Spanish</strong>.</p>
          <p class="langtext2">Studying languages also gave me the opportunity to live and work abroad; I worked in <strong>Brittany</strong>, France for six months before moving to <strong>Heidelberg</strong> to study at Germany's
          oldest university - the <strong>Ruprecht Karls Universitaet Heidelberg. If time permitted I would love to learn Irish. In the past I have volunteered for the pan-European magazine Cafebabel, translating articles from German into English and from French into English. Profile:  "
